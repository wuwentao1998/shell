# shell
This repository contain a simple shell program. It is a project of my operating system course. The specific features I realize are described in the file p1.pdf.

In addition, this file didn't realize some features like fg and many signal processing, which has been realized in my another repository CMU15213/shellLab.

If I have time some day, I will combine the two programs into a more complex shell.
